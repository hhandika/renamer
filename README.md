Renamer is a simple command line application to rename files, whether it is within the same directory, multiple directories, or recursively across nested directories. It is designed to rename at least dozens of files safely. Particularly useful if you need to keep track which files that you rename. I develop the app to renaming hundreds of raw reads Fastq sequences. But, it works with other files too.

You can use it for renaming a few files, but other renaming tools, such as bash build in 'mv' command, or PowerToys on Windows will do it more efficient than Renamer. 

The input is a two columns csv file that consist of the path to your original files and the new name for them. More instruction coming soon...
